## Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities FEMA-Style Grant
I co-authored this grant for the New York State's Office of Resilience Homes & Communities. This grant, titled "Community-Informed Planning to Increase Flood Resilience in Binghamton, New York" describes a $1M, 3-year long initiaitve to equitable increase flooding resiliency among Binghamton, NY, residents via a participatory planning process. This project was a wonderful opportunity to build my grant writing skills while also developing a justice-driven solution to flooding vulnerability.

### Opioid Use Disorder in New York State - Epidemiological Profile
This epidemiological profile summarizes recent data on Opioid Use Disorder, assesses existing community resources related to opioid use, and provides recommendations for community organizations and state legislative bodies to decrease opioid burden in New York State. Through this project, I practiced evidence-based writing and summarizing data on existing dashboards.

### Biosocioecological Evaluation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)
In this paper, I describe the known impacts of PFAS on pregnancy and young children in the United States from 2008-2023 in the context of the biosocioecological model. This paper evaluates the impacts of PFAS exposure from an individual to population-wide level and provides recommendations on how we can use this information to promote environmental justice and population wellbeing.

### Chemung County Poverty Alleviation Literature Review and Recommendations
For this one month long project, I authored a literature review to explore the community context for the dispropotionately high poverty rate in Chemung County, New York, and advocated for evidence-based poverty alleviation interventions. In addition to providing the literature review, I presented my findings to the Chemung County Poverty Reduction Coalition. This project helped me build my literature search skills because sources specific to Chemung County are sparse. Furthermore, because my recommendations needed to be evidence-based, I had to ensure that the recommendations I was proposing were realistic given Chemung County's social, political, and economic conditions.

### Hunts Point Systems Health Outcomes Analysis Paper & Systems Diagram
In this short paper and systems diagram, I describe the impact of Food Distribution Center traffic, poor greenspace, and low access to healthy foods to neighborhoods in Hunts Point, New York City. This paper and systems diagrams strengthened by systems thinking and evidence-based writing skills.
