Welcome! 

I am a Master of Public Health candidate at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, interested in environmental epidemiology and health equity. Before my Master's, I completed my Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and minor in Philosophy at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX. I hope to evaluate health inequities related to harmful environmental toxin exposures to inform community action and policy. My current research interest is on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-related health disparities via drinking water in New York State. For more information about this research--and my other research and professional experiences--please view my CV linked above. Outside of my academic life, I enjoy spending time bird watching, photographing wildlife, and vegan cooking.
