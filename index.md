Welcome! 

I am an incoming PhD student in Epidemiology at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor interested in environmental epidemiology and health equity. I completed my Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and minor in Philosophy at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX and my Masters of Public Health in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I hope to evaluate health inequities related to harmful environmental toxin exposures to inform community action and policy. My current research interest is on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-related health disparities via drinking water in New York State. For more information about this research--and my other research and professional experiences--please view my CV linked above. Outside of my academic life, I enjoy spending time bird watching, photographing wildlife, and vegan cooking.
