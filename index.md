Welcome! 
I am a motivated Master of Public Health student interested in environmental epidemiology and health equity. As a researcher-in-training focused on statistical and epidemiological methods, I hope to evaluate health inequities related to harmful environmental toxin exposures to inform community action and policy. <br> <br>

My current research interest is on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-related health disparities via drinking water in New York State. For more information about this research--and my other research and professional experiences, please view my CV linked above.
